# Preety Eats
A pretty, modern food delivery front-end (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS) inspired by leading apps.

## Features
- Responsive, glassmorphism UI with gradients
- Search, filter by cuisine, veg/non-veg & sort by rating/price/delivery time
- Restaurant list with cards, badges, and skeleton effects
- Restaurant menu page with add-to-cart
- Sliding cart drawer with qty controls, coupon (PREETY50), tax, delivery fee & totals
- Checkout page and mock order success tracker
- Theme toggle (light/dark), localStorage persistence

## Run locally
Open `index.html` directly, or serve with a local server for routing to work well:

```bash

cd preety-eats
python -m http.server 8080
# then open http://localhost:8080
